# PCA-TSNE
PCA is a dimensionality reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimentionality of large datasets,by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.

TSNE is a nonlinear dimentionality reduction  algorithm which is used for exploring high dimensional data.
